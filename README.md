# countyHealth
This is an analysis of county-level health outcomes, based on the University of Wisconsinâ€™s Population Health Institute's county health rankings dataset from 2020. 

Data can be downloaded here: https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/media/document/analytic_data2020_0.csv 

The project conducts extensive EDA and data cleaning to prepare the data. 
Then, clustering is applied to understand underlying groupings of counties with regard to performance on health/social/economic metrics.
Finally, two regression models are fitted on the data to identify variables that can best predict premature death rates.
